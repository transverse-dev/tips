translated:  Hello, I'm Jung Gi-hong. This video is about the development of the stream. It's a video that uses the stream nature. It's about the development of the stream. The audio is also about the development of the stream. I hope this time I can make my own STMT. Let's check the performance while talking.

translated:  Hello, this is Jung Yong. This time, I'm going to check out my STT model. I'm using the SPG2TX model, which is the base of the VNDI Visiper. I'm using a large version of the gun. This guy is holding the gun. It's too big. It's hard to go to the outside. So I can't move. But... What's the problem?

translated:  Hello, I'm Dongkyung. This meeting is about the experiment of the speed to text model. We have tested the OpenAI Whisper model. So, I'm using OpenAI, WISPER, and timing, small, large, base, and WISPERJECTS. I think it's the most suitable for my laptop. WISPERJECTS needs more research. I'm planning to do more research in the future.
